# HA-Dash-UI
a custom dashboard for Home Assistant

I saw this Dashboard on youtube (everything smarthome https://youtu.be/7g9T_vKD4ww?t=911) posted by a user named Fredrik, as of yet the creator has not released the config and I really liked the design so I set out to recreate it with some changes that suit my home. I have provided my yaml file here for anyone to use/change.

Enjoy!
